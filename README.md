# Open from namespace

With this package, you can open a PHP file from this namespace. The package use the fuzzy-finder package (official package). You can open directly from a namespace after an "use" (link) or you can select in a modal which lists all "use" in the current file.

**This package is again in development. I start only to learn to develop a package.**

# How use it ?

Open the command palette (ctrl-shift-P). Select "Open from namespace: List namespace" in a PHP file. Select the namespace which you want open. Paste (ctrl+v) in the modal opened just after.
